        This UI is only a draft for curating the data in the Repco database.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        It only aims to outline the possibilities Repco could offer in terms of
        editing own and other people's contributions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In this version individual contributions can be selected and added to
        so-called playlists which could theoretically be published again on a
        corresponding portal.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        This version is intended for demo purposes only. In a further iteration,
        technical and UI improvements should be made in addition to the required
        functions. This includes caching of data, editing of
        playlists/contributions, roles and user management, mobile capability
        and much more.
      </p>

        <b>We wish a lot of fun trying it out :P</b>
